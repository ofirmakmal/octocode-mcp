## 🌐 For More Details -  [octocode.ai](https://octocode.ai)


**The perfect code assistant that can help understand anything.** Octocode provides AI-powered advanced search with heuristic discovery and smart fallbacks to understand connections between repositories and NPM packages across any privilege level you have.

Instead of manually browsing repositories, ask questions like:
- *"How did React implement concurrent rendering?"*
- *"Show me authentication patterns in Next.js applications"*
- *"Find examples of how to use this specific API"*
- *"What's the architecture of this library?"*
- *"How do I use this MCP tool effectively?"*

## Unique Value Proposition

**The most advanced AI-powered code assistant for understanding connections across the entire GitHub & NPM ecosystem.** While other GitHub MCPs focus on project management or basic operations, Octocode provides unparalleled depth for code discovery and technical research.

**Key Differentiators:**
- **🧠 AI-Powered Search** - Multi-modal search strategies with progressive complexity reduction and context-aware suggestions
- **🔐 Zero-Config Security** - Uses GitHub CLI authentication with organization discovery - no personal access tokens needed
- **🔗 Connection Intelligence** - Maps NPM packages to repositories with commit SHA integration and cross-tool data sharing
- **🌐 Universal Access** - Works seamlessly with public, private, and organization repositories using GitHub CLI permissions
- **⚡ LLM Optimized** - Advanced content minification, intelligent caching, and parallel processing reduces token usage by 80-90%

## Quick Start 🚀

### 1. Install Prerequisites
```bash
# Install Node.js 18.12+
brew install node  # macOS
# or download from https://nodejs.org/

# Install GitHub CLI
brew install gh    # macOS
# or see: https://github.com/cli/cli#installation
```

### 2. Authenticate
```bash
# Login to GitHub (opens browser)
gh auth login

# Login to NPM (for package research)
npm login
```

**🔐 Authentication Benefits:**
- ✅ **No personal access tokens** - Uses GitHub CLI OAuth flow
- ✅ **Enterprise ready** - Works with SSO, 2FA, and organization access
- ✅ **Automatic organization detection** - Instantly accesses your private repositories
- ✅ **Zero configuration** - Uses existing `gh` CLI permissions

### 3. Add to MCP Configuration
```json
{
  "octocode-mcp": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["octocode-mcp"]
  }
}
```

**That's it!** Octocode automatically works with your organization's private repositories.

## DXT Extension 📦

This project is available as a **Desktop Extension (DXT)** for easy installation in AI applications like Claude Desktop.

### For Developers

**Building the DXT Package:**

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Build the DXT package
yarn dxt:pack

# Validate the manifest
yarn dxt:validate

# View package information
yarn dxt:info

# Sign the package (optional)
yarn dxt:sign
```

**DXT Scripts:**
- `yarn dxt:validate` - Validate the manifest.json file
- `yarn dxt:pack` - Build and package the extension as a .dxt file
- `yarn dxt:info` - Show information about the packaged extension
- `yarn dxt:sign` - Sign the package with a self-signed certificate
- `yarn dxt:verify` - Verify the signature of a signed package

**The DXT package includes:**
- Compiled MCP server (`dist/index.js`)
- Extension manifest (`manifest.json`)
- Package metadata (`package.json`)
- Logo and assets (`assets/logo.png`)
- Documentation (`README.md`)

**Building DXT from Source:**
To build the DXT package locally from this repository:
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/bgauryy/octocode-mcp.git
cd octocode-mcp

# Install dependencies and build
yarn install
yarn build
yarn dxt:pack
```

The generated `octocode-mcp.dxt` file can then be installed in Claude Desktop (just click on it and it will open claude desktop with the extension)

## Best Practices 💡

**Effective Questions:**
- Start with natural language - "How does authentication work?"
- Ask for connections - "What libraries use this pattern?"
- Cross-ecosystem queries - "NPM packages that implement X"
- Evolution questions - "How has this approach changed?"

**Pro Tips:**
- Let AI guide discovery - vague queries work great
- Trust smart fallbacks - automatic retry with alternatives
- Build on previous searches - maintain context for deeper exploration
- Works everywhere - public, private, and organization repositories

## Troubleshooting 🔧

```bash
# Check GitHub CLI status
gh auth status

# Re-authenticate if needed
gh auth logout && gh auth login

# Check NPM access
npm whoami

# Clear NPX cache if needed
rm -rf ~/.npm/_npx
```

**Common Solutions:**
- No results? Try broader search terms
- Private repos not found? Check `gh auth status` for organization membership
- Windows users? PowerShell is automatically supported

## Background 💭
