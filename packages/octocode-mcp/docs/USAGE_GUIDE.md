## 🛠️ Available Tools

Octocode provides 8 specialized tools for comprehensive code research:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **`github_search_repositories`** | Search repositories by name, description, topics, and activity |
| **`github_search_code`** | Find code implementations with semantic search and snippets |
| **`github_fetch_content`** | Retrieve file content (partial or complete) with context |
| **`github_view_repo_structure`** | Explore project architecture and directory layouts |
| **`github_search_commits`** | Analyze commit history and code evolution with diffs |
| **`github_search_pull_requests`** | Examine code reviews, discussions, and implementations |
| **`package_search`** | Discover packages with repository connections and metadata |

## 💡 Prompt Examples

### 🏢 **Organization-Specific Research**
```
Use Octocode to research authentication patterns from {{my-org}} repositories
```

### 🔄 **Architecture Flow Analysis**
```
Search for front-end application {{app-name}}. Check which backend services it uses, 
trace the full flow to the database schema, and explain the complete architecture.
```

### 📚 **Examples & Best Practices**
```
Show examples and best practices for implementing Zustand state management in React applications
```

### 📖 **Documentation Generation**
```
Create comprehensive documentation for implementing Zustand in a React 18 application
```

### 🔍 **Code Review & Analysis**
```
Check PR #123 from microsoft/vscode and review the changes against our coding standards
```

### 🎨 **Exploratory Research**
```
Research Three.js documentation and examples for creating 3D walking person animations
```

### 🔧 **Feature Understanding**
```
How does feature X from repo Y work?
```


## ✨ Best Practices

### 🎯 **Be Specific**
- **Good**: "Redis caching patterns in TypeScript microservices"
- **Better**: "Redis caching in {{my-org}} Node.js services"

Octocode performs better with specific identifiers like organization names, repository names, or technology stacks.

### 🔧 **IDE Integration**
- Use Octocode with your IDE to improve existing code
- Search for best practices based on your current implementation
- Get context-aware suggestions for code improvements

### 📝 **Documentation Workflow**
1. Use Octocode to gather comprehensive context
2. Generate documentation with real examples
3. Apply findings to your AI development workflow

### 🔄 **Progressive Research**
1. **Discover** - Find relevant repositories and context
2. **Analyze** - Examine specific implementations and patterns  
3. **Document** - Create comprehensive guides with examples
4. **Apply** - Review and improve your code against discovered standards

## 🏆 Enterprise Use Cases

| Use Case | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Standards Mapping** | Discover and document coding patterns across teams |
| **Security Auditing** | Identify vulnerabilities and access control patterns |
| **Architecture Analysis** | Trace data flows and service dependencies |
| **Knowledge Extraction** | Capture institutional knowledge from commit histories |

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Start Specific**: Begin with your organization or specific repository
2. **Build Context**: Use multiple tools to gather comprehensive information
3. **Create Documentation**: Generate guides and best practices
4. **Iterate & Improve**: Apply findings to enhance your development workflow
